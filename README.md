Welcome to Whale Awkward! This is a project created by the team at [ZZROT](https://zzrot.com). We decided it would be fun to build a simple image with a message, and then see how high we could get it on [Docker-Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

We are currently [ranked 8th](https://hub.docker.com/search/?isAutomated=0&isOfficial=0&page=1&pullCount=1&q=%22%22&starCount=0) amongst all time pulls! [Check it out](https://hub.docker.com/r/zzrot/whale-awkward/) for yourself.
